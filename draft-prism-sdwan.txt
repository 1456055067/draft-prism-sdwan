        PRISM: Protocol for Routing Intelligent Service Mapping
                        draft-prism-sdwan-latest

Abstract

   This document specifies PRISM, an application-aware traffic steering
   protocol for Software-Defined Wide Area Networks (SD-WAN).  PRISM
   provides deep application identification, per-flow tracking, Service
   Level Agreement (SLA) enforcement, and policy-based path selection
   integration with Segment Routing over IPv6 (SRv6).

   PRISM is designed as a companion protocol to CONDUIT (Cryptographic
   Orchestration of Network Distributed Underlay for IPsec Transport),
   together providing a complete open-standard SD-WAN solution.  CONDUIT
   manages the encrypted tunnel fabric while PRISM provides the
   application intelligence and policy enforcement.

   The protocol is fully programmable via gRPC, supports distributed and
   centralized deployment models, and mandates compliance with
   Commercial National Security Algorithm Suite 2.0 (CNSA 2.0)
   cryptographic requirements.

1.  Introduction

1.1.  Problem Statement

   Software-Defined Wide Area Networks (SD-WAN) have emerged as a
   critical technology for enterprises and tactical networks requiring
   Intelligent traffic management across multiple WAN connections.
   However, existing SD-WAN solutions are predominantly proprietary,
   creating several challenges:

   Vendor Lock-in:  Organizations deploying proprietary SD-WAN solutions

      become dependent on a single vendor for features, updates, and
      interoperability.

   Limited Interoperability:  Proprietary solutions cannot interoperate

      with equipment from other vendors, limiting deployment flexibility
      and multi-vendor environments.

   Opaque Operation:  Closed implementations prevent security auditing

      and verification of traffic handling behavior.

   Cryptographic Limitations:  Many commercial SD-WAN products do not

      support government-mandated cryptographic standards such as CNSA
      2.0.

   An open-standard SD-WAN protocol would address these limitations by
   providing a vendor-neutral specification that enables
   interoperability, permits security auditing, and ensures compliance
   with required cryptographic standards.

   SD-WAN functionality comprises two distinct concerns:

   1.  Tunnel Fabric Management: Creating, monitoring, and maintaining
       encrypted tunnels across multiple WAN links.
       [I-D.conduit-tunnel-fabric] addresses this function.

   2.  Application-Aware Traffic Steering: Identifying applications,
       tracking flows, enforcing policies, and selecting optimal paths
       based on application requirements.  This function is addressed by
       PRISM.

1.2.  Relationship to CONDUIT

   PRISM and [I-D.conduit-tunnel-fabric] together form a complete open-
   standard SD-WAN solution with clear separation of responsibilities:

   CONDUIT Responsibilities:

   *  IPsec tunnel lifecycle management (creation, deletion, rekeying)

   *  Tunnel health monitoring (probing, metrics collection)

   *  Metric publishing to SRv6/IGP

   *  IKEv2 security association management

   PRISM Responsibilities:

   *  Application identification (deep packet inspection, heuristics)

   *  Flow tracking and management

   *  Policy definition and enforcement

   *  SLA monitoring and alerting

   *  Traffic class assignment for SRv6 steering

   The relationship can be summarized as: PRISM decides WHAT traffic
   class each flow belongs to; SRv6 decides WHICH path to use based on
   Flex-Algo; CONDUIT ensures the paths EXIST and reports their quality.

1.3.  Design Goals

   PRISM is designed to meet the following goals:

    | Flow Scale               | 10 million concurrent flows per node |
    +--------------------------+--------------------------------------+
    | Application Signatures   | 5000+ applications recognized        |

    | Classification Latency   | Less than 100 microseconds           |
    +--------------------------+--------------------------------------+
    | Policy Scale             | 100,000 policies per node            |

3.  Architecture

3.1.  System Overview

   A PRISM deployment consists of the following components:

   PRISM Controller:  A centralized or distributed management entity

      responsible for policy management and distribution, application
      signature database maintenance, aggregated analytics, and
      reporting, and SLA monitoring dashboard.

   PRISM Node:  A data plane element deployed at network edges

      responsible for application identification, flow tracking, and
      classification, policy enforcement, per-flow metrics collection,
      and SRv6 traffic class assignment.

   CONDUIT Node:  Co-located tunnel fabric manager providing IPsec

      tunnel management and path quality metrics (feeds into SLA
      calculations).

   SRv6 Data Plane:  Forwarding plane that executes traffic engineering

      decisions based on traffic class assignments from PRISM.

3.2.  Deployment Models

   PRISM supports multiple deployment models:

   Distributed Mode:  Each PRISM node operates independently.  Policies

      are configured locally on each node.  No central controller
      required.  Suitable for small deployments or disconnected
      operations.

   Centralized Mode:  PRISM Controller manages all nodes.  Policies

      are defined centrally and distributed to nodes.  Centralized
      analytics and reporting.  Suitable for enterprise deployments.

   Hierarchical Mode:  Regional controllers manage local nodes.  Global

      controller coordinates regional controllers.  Policies can be
      global, regional, or local.  Suitable for large distributed
      deployments.

   Hybrid Mode:  Central controller for policy distribution.  Local

      autonomy for real-time decisions.  Nodes operate independently if
      the controller is unreachable.  Suitable for tactical/resilient
      deployments.

4.  Application Identification

4.1.  Identification Methods

   PRISM employs multiple methods to identify applications:

      +=======================+=======+=============================+
      | Method                | Layer | Description                 |
      +=======================+=======+=============================+
      | Port-based            | L4    | Well-known ports (SSH=22)   |
      +-----------------------+-------+-----------------------------+
      | Protocol Signature    | L7    | Pattern matching in payload |
      +-----------------------+-------+-----------------------------+
      | TLS/SNI Analysis      | L7    | Server Name Indication      |
      +-----------------------+-------+-----------------------------+
      | DNS Correlation       | L7    | Map DNS queries to flows    |
      +-----------------------+-------+-----------------------------+
      | Certificate Analysis  | L7    | X.509 certificate fields    |
      +-----------------------+-------+-----------------------------+
      | Behavioral Heuristics | L3-L7 | Traffic patterns/timing     |
      +-----------------------+-------+-----------------------------+
      | Machine Learning      | L3-L7 | Trained classifiers         |
      +-----------------------+-------+-----------------------------+
      | IP Reputation         | L3    | Known service IP ranges     |
      +-----------------------+-------+-----------------------------+

                                  Figure 2

   Classification proceeds through methods in order of reliability until
   a confident identification is achieved.

4.2.  Encrypted Traffic Analysis

   For encrypted traffic (TLS/DTLS), PRISM uses metadata analysis
   without decryption:

   TLS Server Name Indication (SNI):  The SNI field in the TLS

      The client Hello message reveals the intended server hostname.
      This is the primary method for HTTPS classification.

   TLS Certificate Analysis:  Server certificates contain identifying

      information, including Common Name, Subject Alternative Names,
      Organization, and Issuer.

   JA3/JA3S Fingerprinting:  TLS handshake characteristics create a
      unique

      fingerprints for client and server implementations.

   Encrypted Traffic Behavioral Analysis:  Statistical analysis of

      packet sizes, timing, and directionality can identify applications
      without payload inspection.

   IMPORTANT: PRISM does not perform TLS interception or decryption.
   All encrypted traffic analysis is performed on metadata and
   observable traffic characteristics.

4.3.  Application Categories

   Applications are organized into categories for policy management:

          +========================+============================+
          | Category               | Description                |
          +========================+============================+

          +------------------------+----------------------------+
          | file-transfer          | File sharing (SharePoint,  |
          |                        | Box, FTP)                  |
          +------------------------+----------------------------+
          | web-browsing           | General web traffic        |

          +------------------------+----------------------------+
          | remote-access          | VPN, RDP, SSH              |

5.  Flow Management

5.1.  Flow Identification

   A composite key identifies flows:

   Standard 5-Tuple:

   *  IP Protocol (8 bits)

   *  Source IP Address (128 bits for IPv6)

   *  Destination IP Address (128 bits for IPv6)

   *  Source Port (16 bits)

   *  Destination Port (16 bits)

   Extended Identifiers (optional):

   *  VLAN ID

   *  VRF/VPN ID

   *  Ingress interface

5.2.  Flow Lifecycle

   Flows progress through the following states:

   NEW:  First packet observed.  Application identification in progress.

      Default traffic class applied.

   CLASSIFYING:  Multiple packets observed.  Application identification

      in progress.  May transition to ESTABLISHED once classification
      confidence exceeds threshold.

   ESTABLISHED:  Application identified with sufficient confidence.

      Traffic class assigned based on policy.  SLA monitoring is active.

   CLOSING:  Connection termination detected.  Preparing to collect

      final statistics.

   CLOSED:  Flow terminated.  Final statistics recorded.  Entry

      scheduled for removal after reporting.

6.  Policy Framework

6.1.  Policy Model

   PRISM policies follow a match-action model with the following
   structure:

   *  Policy ID: Unique identifier

   *  Name: Human-readable name

   *  Priority: Evaluation order (lower = higher priority)

   *  Match: Conditions that select applicable traffic

   *  Action: Operations to perform on matching traffic

   *  Schedule: Optional time-based activation

6.2.  Match Conditions

   Policies can match on:

   *  Source/destination IP address or prefix

   *  Port or port range

   *  Specific application ID or category

   *  Application risk level

   *  Protocol (TCP, UDP, etc.)

   *  DSCP value

   *  Time of day

   *  Ingress interface or zone

6.3.  Actions

   When a policy matches, the following actions may be applied:

   Traffic Class Assignment:  Set traffic class (maps to SRv6 color),

      set DSCP value

   Path Selection:  Prefer specific path characteristics, avoid specific

      paths, pin to a specific path

   SLA Assignment:  Apply SLA profile, set violation actions

      Bandwidth Management: Rate limit, bandwidth guarantee

   Security:  Permit, deny, redirect to inspection


6.4.  SLA Definitions

   Standard SLA Profiles:

     +================+=========+========+======+====================+
     | Profile        | Latency | Jitter | Loss | Use Case           |
     +================+=========+========+======+====================+
     | realtime-voice | 150ms   | 30ms   | 1%   | VoIP               |
     +----------------+---------+--------+------+--------------------+
     | realtime-video | 200ms   | 50ms   | 1%   | Video conferencing |
     +----------------+---------+--------+------+--------------------+
     | interactive    | 300ms   | 100ms  | 2%   | Virtual desktop    |
     +----------------+---------+--------+------+--------------------+
     | transactional  | 500ms   | N/A    | 0.1% | Database, API      |
     +----------------+---------+--------+------+--------------------+
     | best-effort    | N/A     | N/A    | N/A  | General browsing   |
     +----------------+---------+--------+------+--------------------+

                                  Figure 4

7.  SRv6 Integration

7.1.  Traffic Class to SRv6 Color Mapping

   PRISM assigns traffic classes that map to SRv6 policy colors:

       +===============+=======+===========+=======================+
       | Traffic Class | Color | Flex-Algo | Description           |
       +===============+=======+===========+=======================+
       | realtime      | 100   | 128       | Voice, real-time C2   |
       +---------------+-------+-----------+-----------------------+
       | video         | 200   | 129       | Video conferencing    |
       +---------------+-------+-----------+-----------------------+
       | interactive   | 300   | 128       | VDI, interactive apps |
       +---------------+-------+-----------+-----------------------+
       | business      | 400   | default   | Business applications |
       +---------------+-------+-----------+-----------------------+
       | best-effort   | 0     | default   | Default treatment     |
       +---------------+-------+-----------+-----------------------+

                                  Figure 5

7.2.  Dynamic Path Selection

   PRISM influences path selection through traffic class assignment, not
   direct path manipulation.  The sequence is:

   1.  PRISM classifies flow and assigns traffic class

   2.  Traffic class maps to SRv6 color

   3.  SRv6 color maps to SR policy

   4.  SR policy specifies Flex-Algo or explicit path

   5.  SRv6 data plane forwards accordingly

   This maintains clean separation: PRISM determines the application
   requirements, SRv6 satisfies them.

8.  SLA Monitoring and Enforcement

8.1.  SLA Metrics

   PRISM monitors:

   Latency: End-to-end delay.  Measured via TCP timestamps or probes.

   Jitter: Variation in packet delay.  Calculated per [RFC3550].

   Packet Loss:  Percentage not delivered.  Inferred from TCP

      retransmissions.

   Throughput:  Bytes per second over measurement interval.


8.2.  Remediation Actions

   When SLA violations are detected:

   Alert Only:  Generate alert, no corrective action.


   Reclassify:  Move the flow to a different traffic class.


   Path Switch:  Signal SRv6 to prefer the alternate path.


   Escalate: Notify the external system to take action.

9.  Control Protocol

9.1.  Transport

   PRISM control messages are transported via UDP on port 4796.

   All control messages are authenticated using HMAC-SHA-384.

9.2.  Message Header

10.  gRPC API

   PRISM exposes functionality through five gRPC services:

   PolicyService:  Policy lifecycle management (CRUD for policies, SLA

      profiles)

   ApplicationService:  Application signature management


   FlowService:  Flow visibility and real-time streaming


   AnalyticsService:  SLA compliance reports and traffic analytics


   ConfigService:  Node configuration


   All gRPC connections MUST use mutual TLS (mTLS) with CNSA 2.0
   compliant certificates.

11.  Cryptographic Requirements

   PRISM implementations MUST comply with CNSA 2.0:

   *  AES-256-GCM for symmetric encryption

   *  ECDH P-384 for key exchange

   *  ECDSA P-384 for digital signatures

   *  SHA-384 for hashing

   *  HMAC-SHA-384 for message authentication

   The gRPC API MUST use TLS 1.3 with the TLS_AES_256_GCM_SHA384 cipher
   suite.

12.  Security Considerations

12.1.  Privacy Considerations

   PRISM performs deep packet inspection, which raises privacy concerns.
   PRISM analyzes metadata of encrypted traffic but does not decrypt
   contents.  Organizations SHOULD define data retention policies.

12.2.  Application Identification Risks

   Sophisticated actors may attempt to evade identification.
   Implementations SHOULD employ multiple identification methods and
   provide mechanisms to review classifications.

12.3.  Policy Security

   Policies MUST be authenticated using HMAC-SHA-384.  Policy changes
   SHOULD require appropriate authorization and be logged for audit.

13.  IANA Considerations

13.1.  UDP Port Allocation

   This document requests the allocation of UDP port 4796 for PRISM
   control messages.

13.2.  Application Category Registry

   This document requests the creation of a "PRISM Application
   Categories." registry with initial values from 0x01 (unified-
   communications) through 0xFF (unknown).
